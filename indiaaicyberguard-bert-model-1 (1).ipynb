through twitter on feb th hence i verified by cibil report just to be cautious and shockingly i found that a loan has been availed in my name without my knowledge by misuing the pan card i immediately sent an email communication to dhani support team on sunday th feb a loan collection agent came to home asking for the loan to be repaid he did not had proper answer as to what documents were received to approve the loan there were numerous people on social media raising similar complaints and news articles covering the same which i have attached please search with hashtag dhani to find out more such frauds and the company is not taking any actions against such incidents i feel this large scale financial fraud cannot happen without any insider job i would request you to inquire this financial fraud and bring those culprits to justice thank you  \n648

is asking for money on paytm and phonepe i have recording also i can send it later this person asked for money on olx and then asked me to deduct amount from my account i have his recording too they might have done this to other people also so please look at it they first contacted me on olx and then asked me to send money through the paytm they are using the name of indian army in vain a very sad state it needs to be checked as soon as possible no money was deducted from my account but he asked me to deduct the amount the same fraud is done with other people also this is a ridiculous thing that i need to add words i am not writing an essay for college i need to submit a complaint as soon as possible so that they do not do it with other people so why is there a need to write words i am still characters short and i do not know what to do so i am just rambling here for the next lines this is so idiotic that nothing useful will come out of it i hope that my essay finds you in good

playstation and those voucher codes are of no use to me i made a comploaint to amazon but they denied providing resolution by saying that they cannot do anything in this matter and i have to talk to the seller i even contacted the seller and the seller too refused to cancel the order and refund the amount back as it was email delivery the order was not placed by me this incident happened at am at night and i was asleep and nobody was using the mobile at that time this was automatically ordered from my account even the codes provided to me are the used codes as they are not getting redeemed too while redeeming it says that these codes are already redeemed the order got placed using my amazon pay later service and it exhausted my transaction limit by placing these orders please provide some solution to this as to how can i get my refund back as those codes are of no use to me and it was not at all ordered by me too  \n1275
